# Mute Discord User

A simple tool to mute discord users.

# How to use:
Run the .exe file, and follow the instructions, its that simple!
### Warning
**Discord has to stay open, ideally on a second monitor due to how this works, if discord moves and the program clicks the wrong thing, I take no responsibility for anything that happens. If you do not have server mute permissions, this will only work locally.**
