**Discord has to stay open, ideally on a second monitor due to how this works, if discord moves and the program clicks the wrong thing, I take no responsibility for anything that happens. If you do not have server mute permissions, this will only work locally.**

# Mute Discord User

This allows you to press **ctrl+m** to mute the specified discord user
To exit the application press **ctrl+n**

This works by moving the mouse to the discord user, then clicking server mute or mute, depends on what you specify.
The setup process allows you to hover over the selected user, then hover over the mute button, it also allows time to do this.
